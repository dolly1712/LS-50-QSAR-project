# Problem Statement:
We want to build a computer model that can predict how toxic certain chemicals are to fish. This helps us understand the risks these chemicals pose to aquatic life without needing to test them on actual fish, which can be harmful and time-consuming.

# Objective or Aim:
Our goal is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the concentration of a chemical that would cause 50% of fish to die in a test batch over 96 hours. This prediction will be based on information about the chemical's molecular structure.
